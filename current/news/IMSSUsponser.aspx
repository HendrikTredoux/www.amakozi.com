<h1>Amakozi Technologies sponsors Metallic Silhouette Shooting</h1>
<h3>Monday, 02 Oct 2006</h3>
<p>Amakozi Technologies is the technology sponsor for Metallic Silhouette Shooting in South Africa.</p>
				<p>The sport, which originated in Mexico, receives no government funding, has several hundred active 
				participants in South Africa, and is practised in eleven countries worldwide.</p>
				<p>Silhouette shooting consists of knocking down steel targets, in the shape of chickens, pigs, turkeys 
				and rams, which are placed at various distances. Small bore (.22) distances go up to 100m for rifle 
				and handguns, whereas the range for big bore, centre fire handguns is up to 200m, and for centre fire 
				rifles up to 500m.</p>
				<p>Until the 1940's the sport was practised exclusively in Mexico and the southern United States, and 
				live animals were used as targets. Common sense then prevailed, and the targets were changed to steel 
				silhouettes. More information is available on the <a href="http://www.samssa.org.za" target="_blank">
				SAMSSA website</a>.</p>
				<p>South Africa is one of the world leaders in Metallic Silhouette Shooting, with several reigning world 
				champions in the different events.</p>

				<p>Amakozi Technologies's sponsorship includes assistance with squadding and scorekeeping at the 2006 
				IMSSU World Championships, as well as the SA National Championships, and events held under the auspices 
				of the  Western Province Metallic Silhouette Shooting Association.</p>
				<p>In addition, Amakozi Technologies runs the websites for WPMSSA and SAMSSA, the national controlling 
				body, as well as the website for the 2006 IMSSU World Championships that was held in Bloemfontein.</p>
