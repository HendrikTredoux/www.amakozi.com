<h1>Amakozi Technologies moves office</h1>
<h3>Monday, 10 Mar 2008</h3>
<p>Amakozi Technologies has moved to new premises in the Pastorie Park office 
				complex in Somerset West on 1 March.</p>
				<p>The move was inevitable, when the company started outgrowing its original 
				premises in neighbouring Strand. The new offices are spacious enough 
				for future expansion.</p>
				<p>The new offices are situated in a quiet area, in a secure office complex, 
				surrounded by parks, with numerous oak trees decorating the outdoor areas 
				of the complex. The surroundings are perfect for an IT company that is not 
				dependent on walk-in business, by offering an open, aesthetically pleasing 
				environment without the noise and distractions that plague most other 
				office complexes.</p>
				<p>Amakozi's telephone number has changed to +27 (0)21 851-2102. All other 
				contact information stays the same.</p>
