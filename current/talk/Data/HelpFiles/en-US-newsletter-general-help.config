<p>
	There are a few supported token replacements that allow you to enter a token that will be replaced when the newsletter is sent to users. The most important token is the #unsubscribe# token which is required. The #unsubscribe# token will be replaced with an link to un-subscribe from the newsletter. It is required by anti spam laws to include such a link.</p>
<p>
	There are 2 optional tokens that are also supported.</p>
<p>
	#username# will be replaced by the user email address</p>
<p>
	<span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 13px; ">#viewaswebpage#</span>&nbsp;will be replaced with a link to view the newsletter as a web page (if Allow Archive View is Enabled on the Newsletter definition).</p>
