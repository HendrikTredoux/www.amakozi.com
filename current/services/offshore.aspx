<h3>Planning and Requirements</h3>
<p>Amakozi Technologies has highly skilled consultants, who can easily translate customer requirements into development and delivery.  
During the requirement phase the customer document the basic requirements for what Amakozi needs to develop.  
If applicable, the customer provides sample design information, e.g. HTML, CSS, etc.  The customer also provides 
Amakozi with the timeframe/deadline for the deliverables.</p>
<p>A conference between Amakozi and the customer will be set up to discuss the requirements.  
This can be done via an online phone or video conference, or on site at either the customer or Amakozi premises.  
During this conference Amakozi will suggest options 
for the development, which the customer needs to approve.  The customer also has the opportunity at this stage to suggest 
changes to the requirements, or additional requirements</p><br>
