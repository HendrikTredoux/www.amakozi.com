<h1>Customer Case Study - Nationwide</h1>
<h3>Customer Requirements</h3>
<p>Build a prototype for auto loan application.</p>

<h3>The Tailored Solution</h3>
<b>Nationwide Bank Auto Loan</b><br/>
<p>Amakozi was approached to build Nationwide a prototype application. The application was created with the idea of giving the user the chance of using a friendly interface from where the user can take out a loan and purchase a car in a simple, yet effective manner. This software application got named the Nationwide Bank Auto Loan application.</p>
<p>The prototype project was used to give Nationwide’s developers a chance to learn from the Backbase consultants and also to make requirements for the final project clear to help gain a complete understanding of the various technologies used for implementation. Amakozi assisted Nationwide with the setup of a development environment helping them integrate Backbase Portalserver with the Forms software and also configuring the system to run with their Oracle database.</p>
<p>The Auto Loan application made use of Backbase’s Forms technology to build an application so users can buy a vehicle completely online with minimum effort. Using Backbase Forms insured for a quick and safe way that a user can apply for an auto loan. The Backbase consultants worked closely with Nationwide’s requirements team to create a user friendly frontend. Initially different scenarios were created for each mobile, tablet and PC, but after the discovery phase it was decided that one generic scenario suitable for any device should be the best way to go. The application was made fully responsive on any device, whether using a tablet, mobile phone or PC.</p>
<p>Main comments from Nationwide’s side after the delivery of the Auto Loan Application were:</p>
<li>Looks awesome</li>
<li>It is light years ahead in look and feel compared to our current applications</li>
<li>Responsiveness is great</li>
<p>For the future it is expected that Nationwide will further expand this application to not only handle loans for cars, but also other transport vehicles such as boats, motorbikes and other.</p>
<p>The quality and time to delivery of the product as well as the good relationship built between Nationwide and Backbase (and Amakozi) left the door open for similar projects in the near future.</p>
