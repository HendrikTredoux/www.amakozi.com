<h1>Customer Case Study - Quest Software</h1>
<h3>Customer Requirements</h3>
<p>Quest Software® needed to implement SDL Tridion 2009 to completely manage their marketing and support operations websites.</p>
<p>This involved implementing a new website design utilizing the latest Microsoft®.NET technologies and migrating existing content to the new system.</p>
<p>The new content management system had to tightly integrate with systems such as Amdocs® Clarify CRM, the dedicated website indexing service provided by Endeca® and some proprietary Quest Software systems.</p>
<p>The implementation had to cater for language and country specific versions of content in future. Extensive control over content creation and release processes was an absolute must have, especially for the support operations website since the complete customer knowledge base had to be managed through Tridion.</p>
<p>Extensive knowledge transfer to in-house resources.</p>

<h3>The Tailored Solution</h3>
<p>Assisted with installation and configuration of SDL Tridion 2009 on four increasingly scaled out environments: DEV, QA, STAGE and PROD.</p>
<p>In depth meetings were held with the key stakeholders to obtain sufficient knowledge of business needs and processes in order to translate their requirements to a customized, best fitting solution after which the complete design and implementation commenced.</p>
<p>Various customizations to the out of box product were made to accommodate complex requirements.  The implementation involved a broad range of SDL Tridion modules apart from the core system.  These included extended Tridion content delivery modules, Tridion content workflow implementations and customized Tridion content creation tools.</p>
<p>We worked closely with the customer technology team to integrate with existing and new systems while ensuring functionality is guaranteed as per the customer’s business and functional requirements.
Custom scripts were developed to migrate large amounts of existing content from the customer’s previous content management system.
