<h1>Customer Case Study - Move.com</h1>

<h3>Customer Requirements</h3>
<p>Move.com® required their SDL Tridion® system to be upgraded from an older version to the latest SDL Tridion 2009 SP1 release.</p>
<p>Along with the upgrade user training was required to familiarize existing in-house end-users and developers with the latest offerings of SDL Tridion 2009.</p>
<p>Move.com also wanted to not only upgrade the core system but also introduce newly released upgrades of additional SDL Tridion modules such as SDL Tridion SiteEdit™ 2009.</p>
<p>Move.com also required enhancing their content publishing security strategy for a newly developed website.</p>


<h3>The Tailored Solution</h3>
<p>Since SDL Tridion is at the core of the customer’s website management process and to minimize impact on the day-to-day operations at Move.com, it was obvious to follow a staged approach for the whole upgrade process.  Move.com also introduced new Microsoft Windows 2003 64-bit servers for parts of the system.  These included new servers for hosting the content manager, a dedicated publisher and a dedicated deployer. </p>

<p>Upgrade tests were done on offline copies of the various databases involved for each environment (DEV, QA and PROD) to ensure no errors were encountered with this absolutely crucial part of the upgrade.</p>

<p>Amakozi Technologies upgraded and configured the development and testing environments and then assisted Move.com system administrators to upgrade the production environment ensuring knowledge transfer to enable Move.com to be more confident in SDL Tridion maintenance.  SiteEdit 2009 was installed and configured on all environments in the same fashion.</p>

<p>Working closely with the Move.com technology team, a well fitting solution was proposed for enhanced security regarding content deployment for a certain newly developed website.</p>

<p>After completing the on-site leg of the project, continued support was put in place to provide back-up for Move.com system administrators to maintain the content management system.</p>
